## Why This is a Good Idea

* **Addresses Learning Curve:** The abacus, while simple in design, requires understanding of place value and bead representation. A generic tutorial might not be sufficient for all users, especially young children.
* **Personalized Learning:** Age-based modules allow for a more personalized learning experience, catering to the cognitive abilities and attention spans of different age groups.
* **Increased Engagement:** Tailoring content to specific age groups can make learning more engaging and less frustrating, encouraging users to continue.
* **Improved Retention:** Breaking down concepts into age-appropriate steps helps users grasp and retain information more effectively.
* **Wider Audience:** This approach makes the abacus accessible to a wider audience, from young children to adults, each with their own learning needs.

## Architectural Considerations

### Practice Mode Architecture
1. **Layout System**
   - Tutorial Mode: Embedded in tutorial panel
   - Practice Mode: 
     * Side-by-side layout with abacus
     * Resizable panels
     * Independent window management
     * Mobile-responsive design

2. **Component Structure**
   ```plaintext
   /js/modules/lessons/age-5-7/
   ├── introductionModule.js      # Tutorial handling
   └── games/
       ├── countingGame.js        # Game logic
       └── layouts/
           ├── tutorialLayout.js  # Tutorial layout
           └── practiceLayout.js  # Standalone layout
   ```

3. **Layout Configurations**
   - Desktop:
     * Abacus: 65% width (min 500px)
     * Game: 35% width (min 300px)
     * Resizable divider
   - Mobile:
     * Abacus: 60% height
     * Game: 40% height
     * Collapsible panels

4. **State Management**
    - Layout mode persistence
    - Window position memory
    - Cross-device synchronization
    - Clean state transitions
    - Error recovery handling
        * Mode switch failures
        * Layout restoration
        * Connection loss recovery
        * State rollback procedures

## General Module Considerations

* **Adaptive Learning:** Consider implementing an adaptive learning system that adjusts the difficulty based on the user's performance.
* **Progress Tracking:** Track the user's progress and provide feedback to motivate them.
* **Gamification:** Use gamification techniques like points, badges, and leaderboards to make learning more engaging.
* **Clear Instructions:** Provide clear and concise instructions for each exercise.
* **Accessibility:** Ensure the module is accessible to users with disabilities, including screen reader support and keyboard navigation.
* **Multi-Language Support:** Ensure the module supports all the languages currently supported by the application.
